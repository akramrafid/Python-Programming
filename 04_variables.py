# Variables
x = 10  # x is assigned the integer value 10
y = 5   # y is assigned the integer value 5
z = x + y  # z is assigned the sum of x and y
print("The value of z is:", z)  # Output: The value of z is: 15

name = "Alice"  # name is assigned the string value "Alice"
greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"  # greeting is assigned a concatenated string
print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, Alice!    
pi = 3.14159  # pi is assigned the floating-point value of pi
radius = 2.5  # radius is assigned the floating-point value 2.5

area = pi * (radius ** 2)  # area is calculated using the formula for the area of a circle
print("The area of the circle is:", area)  # Output: The area of the circle is: 19.6349375  

is_student = True  # is_student is assigned the boolean value True
print("Is Alice a student?", is_student)  # Output: Is Alice a student? True
counter = 0  # counter is initialized to 0
counter += 1  # counter is incremented by 1
print("Counter value:", counter)  # Output: Counter value: 1

# Reassigning variables
x = 20  # x is now assigned the integer value 20    
print("The new value of x is:", x)  # Output: The new value of x is: 20 
y = y * 2  # y is now assigned the value of y multiplied by 2
print("The new value of y is:", y)  # Output: The new value of y is: 10
name = "Bob"  # name is now assigned the string value "Bob"
print("The new name is:", name)  # Output: The new name is: Bob
